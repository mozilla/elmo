This callback is created so that we don't actually do anything with the
Javascript files are they are passed around by django_compressor.

Once we're confident that django_compressor works we can disable this
filter and start using a real compressor package.

To use this filter set this in your settings:

    COMPRESS_JS_FILTERS = (
      'filters.void_js_filter.VoidJSFilter',
    )

from compressor.filters import CallbackOutputFilter


class VoidJSFilter(CallbackOutputFilter):
    callback = "filters.void_js_filter.jsvoid"


def jsvoid(content):
    return content

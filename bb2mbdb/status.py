'''Buildbot StatusReceiver for bb2mbdb

The main entry point for buildbot status notifications are a
- fake scheduler to get all changes, and a
- StatusReceiver to get all builder.

Also add a fake ChangeSource, so that we can ensure the nextNumber
on ChangeMaster is set if we're resetting the master. That way, we don't
introduce conflicts with existing mbdb data.

Both are set up by calling into
 setupBridge()
so that you can pass in a single settings.py, and a BuildMasterConfig.

'''Buildbot StatusReceiver for bb2mbdb

The main entry point for buildbot status notifications are a
- fake scheduler to get all changes, and a
- StatusReceiver to get all builder.

Both are set up by calling into 
 setupBridge()
so that you can pass in a single settings.py, and a BuildMasterConfig.
'''

# Notes on transaction handling:
# There are two patterns for the transaction handling in the status
# plugin below. Firstly, for methods that simply update the db, the
# handlers are decorated with @transation.commit_on_success. For
# handlers that attach new handlers, the decoration is
# @transition.commit_manually, and transaction.commit() is called after
# the child db objects is got, and before the child listener is created.
